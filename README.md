# Project Overview

This project aims to extract valuable insights from a dataset providing a simplified representation of sales transactions. The dataset encompasses various aspects of sales, including different products, customers, and markets over time. Each transaction is characterized by essential details such as the product sold, the involved customer, the market where the transaction occurred, the transaction date, the quantity of products sold, the sales amount, and the currency in which the sales amount is recorded.

## Resources Utilized

- **MySQL Workbench:** Utilized for database exploration, querying, and initial data understanding.
- **Power BI:** Leveraged for the ETL process, data modeling, and visualization creation.

## Project Details

1. **Data Extraction and Exploration:**
   - Downloaded the SQL script containing the dataset [link](https://codebasics.io/resources/sales-insights-data-analysis-project).
   - Executed initial SQL queries to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

2. **ETL Process with Power Query:**
   - Utilized Power Query in Power BI to perform the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process.
   - Handled inconsistent values, created additional columns, and filtered data for better accuracy.

3. **Data Modeling:**
   - Identified and resolved incomplete relationships within the dataset.
   - Established connections between relevant tables to enhance data coherence.

4. **Measure Creation:**
   - Formulated essential measures such as "Revenue" and "Sales Quantity" to facilitate more insightful visualizations.

5. **Interactive Reports:**
   - Developed interactive reports, including an "Overview Sales" report and a "Region Overview" report.
   - These reports offer in-depth insights into sales information, allowing for a detailed examination of specific regions.

6. **Visualization and Interpretation:**
   - Utilized Power BI's visualization capabilities to create dynamic and visually appealing charts and graphs.
   - Interpretation of the visualizations provides a clear understanding of sales trends, customer behavior, and market performance.

7. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - The project emphasizes an iterative process, encouraging continuous refinement based on user feedback and evolving business requirements.
   - Ensured that the reports are user-friendly and provide actionable insights.

By leveraging MySQL Workbench and Power BI, this project not only extracts insights from raw data but also presents them in a visually compelling manner, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions based on comprehensive sales analytics.
